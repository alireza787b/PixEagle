# Description: This script configures the Ethernet interface to use DHCP for internet access.
#              It also makes the DHCP configuration persistent across reboots and performs a connectivity test.

# User-configurable parameters
INTERFACE="eth0" # Network interface to be configured
PING_TARGET="8.8.8.8" # IP address to ping (Google DNS server for testing internet connection)
CONNECTION_NAME="Wired connection 1" # Name of the NetworkManager connection (adjust if needed)

# Function to display information to the user
function info {
    echo -e "\e[34m[INFO]\e[0m $1"
}

# Function to display success messages
function success {
    echo -e "\e[32m[SUCCESS]\e[0m $1"
}

# Function to display error messages
function error {
    echo -e "\e[31m[ERROR]\e[0m $1"
}

# Function to prompt user action
function prompt_user {
    echo -e "\e[33m[NOTE]\e[0m $1"
