    """
    PID_GAINS (dict): Contains the PID gains for each control axis. The PID controller helps
            to minimize the error between the current state and the desired setpoint. Adjustments to these
            gains can be made based on the drone's response during flight tests.

            - Proportional (P) Gain: Determines how aggressively the PID reacts to the current error. Increasing
              this value will make the drone respond more quickly to errors, but too high a value can lead to
              oscillations and instability.
            
            - Integral (I) Gain: Addresses the cumulative error in the system, helping to eliminate steady-state
              errors. Adjusting this gain helps when the drone fails to reach the setpoint, but too much can
              lead to overshooting and oscillations.
            
            - Derivative (D) Gain: Reacts to the rate of change of the error, providing a damping effect.
              Increasing this gain helps to reduce overshooting and settling time, improving the stability.

        Example usage:
            To increase responsiveness, consider increasing the 'P' gain, but monitor for instability.
            If the drone consistently overshoots the target, increase the 'D' gain for better damping.
            If there is a persistent offset that never corrects itself, increase the 'I' gain slightly.

    Gain scheduling allows the drone control system to adapt PID gains based on the current altitude,

    control needs vary with altitude.
