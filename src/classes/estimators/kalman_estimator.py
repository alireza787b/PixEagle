KalmanEstimator Module
----------------------

This module implements the `KalmanEstimator` class, which provides a Kalman Filter-based estimator for 2D position, velocity, and acceleration estimation in the context of aerial target tracking.

Project Information:
- Project Name: PixEagle
- Repository: https://github.com/alireza787b/PixEagle
- Date: October 2024
- Author: Alireza Ghaderi
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alireza787b

Overview:
---------
The `KalmanEstimator` uses a constant acceleration model to predict and update the state of a tracked object. The Kalman Filter is a recursive optimal estimator that fuses noisy measurements to produce estimates of unknown variables that are more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone.

Purpose:
--------
In aerial target tracking, the Kalman Filter helps in smoothing out the noisy measurements obtained from the tracker, providing a more accurate and stable estimate of the target's position and motion. This is particularly useful when the measurements are noisy or when the target exhibits unpredictable motion due to acceleration.

Key Features:
-------------
- **State Vector**: The state vector includes position `(x, y)`, velocity `(dx, dy)`, and acceleration `(ddx, ddy)`.
- **Measurement Model**: Only position measurements `(x, y)` are used, as velocity and acceleration are not directly measured.
- **Process and Measurement Noise Covariances**: Tunable parameters that affect the filter's responsiveness and smoothness.
- **Normalization**: Provides normalized estimates suitable for control inputs that require normalized coordinates.

Usage:
------
The `KalmanEstimator` is integrated into the tracking system and can be enabled or disabled via parameters. It is used to improve the robustness and accuracy of the tracking by providing filtered estimates of the target's position.

Disabling the Estimator:
------------------------
To disable the estimator, set the parameter `USE_ESTIMATOR` to `False` in the `Parameters` class. This will cause the system to rely solely on the raw measurements from the tracker.

Tuning Parameters:
------------------
- **ESTIMATOR_PROCESS_NOISE_VARIANCE**: Higher values make the filter more responsive to changes but may introduce noise.
- **ESTIMATOR_MEASUREMENT_NOISE_VARIANCE**: Higher values make the filter trust the measurements less, leading to smoother estimates but potential lag.
- **ESTIMATOR_INITIAL_STATE_COVARIANCE**: Determines the initial uncertainty of the state estimates.

Integration:
------------
The estimator is integrated into the tracking pipeline. The tracker provides measurements to the estimator, which then produces filtered estimates. The `AppController` uses these estimates for control decisions, such as commanding the UAV to follow the target.

Extending and Building New Estimators:
--------------------------------------
To build a new estimator:
1. Create a new class that inherits from `BaseEstimator`.
2. Implement all abstract methods defined in `BaseEstimator`.
3. Add the new estimator to the `estimator_factory.py` for easy creation.

Notes:
------
- Ensure that the time step `dt` is updated accurately to reflect the actual time between measurements.
- The estimator assumes a constant acceleration model; if the target's motion model differs significantly, consider modifying the state transition matrix accordingly.
- This estimator is part of the PixEagle project developed by Alireza Ghaderi in October 2024. For more information, visit the project repository or contact via LinkedIn.
