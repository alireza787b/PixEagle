# PixEagle Tracker Schema Configuration
# This file defines all available tracker data types and their requirements
# Allows easy addition of new tracker schemas without code changes
#
# Note on coordinate ranges:
# - Normalized coordinates can exceed [0.0, 1.0] when objects are partially off-screen
# - Range [-2.0, 2.0] allows for complete off-screen tracking while preventing extreme outliers
