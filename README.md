## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up PixEagle, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Linux (recommended). Windows is supported but only recommended for X-Plane SITL tests. (see [Integration Guide for Follow Mode Tracker Test with X-Plane and SITL
](https://github.com/alireza787b/PixEagle/blob/smart-param/Follow_Mode_Xplane_Guide.md)).
- **Python:** Version 3.9 or higher.
- **Python Virtual Environment:** `venv` module.
- **Python Packages:** As listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Additional Tools:** `tmux`, `lsof` for better control and management.

#### Install Prerequisites on Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip tmux lsof 
sudo apt install -y python3-gi gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0 gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-base 
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/alireza787b/PixEagle.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ~/PixEagle
    ```

3. **Initialize the Project:**

    Run the initialization script to set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and handle configurations:

    ```bash
    bash init_pixeagle.sh
    ```

    **Note:** If you prefer manual setup, you can create a virtual environment, creating configs and env files and install the requirements manually.


4. **Install Node.js and npm:**

    PixEagle's dashboard requires Node.js and npm. Install them by following the instructions for your operating system on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

    **Note:** Using package managers like `apt` may install outdated versions. It's recommended to use the official installation methods.

### Configuration

1. **Update Application Configuration:**

    Edit the main application configuration file to suit your setup:

    ```bash
    nano configs/config.yaml
    ```

    Adjust settings such as video source, PID gains, camera angles, and other parameters.

2. **Update Dashboard Configuration:**

    Edit the dashboard's environment variables:

    ```bash
    nano dashboard/.env
    ```

    Update server IP addresses, ports, and other relevant settings to match your system.


### PX4 Integration

To integrate PixEagle with PX4 for flight control, you need to set up MAVLink communication and ensure all necessary components are installed and configured correctly.

#### Installing MAVLink Router and MAVLink2REST

1. **Install MAVLink Router:**
     On systems like Raspberry Pi or Jetson, you can use the `mavlink-anywhere` auto-start daemon to automatically route serial connections (e.g., `/dev/ttyS0` or `/dev/ttyAMA0` or `/dev/ttyTHS1`) to UDP endpoints (e.g., `127.0.0.1:14550`, `127.0.0.1:14540`, `127.0.0.1:14569`) using the following command:
    Navigate to your home directory and clone the `mavlink-anywhere` repository:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/alireza787b/mavlink-anywhere.git
    cd mavlink-anywhere
    bash install_mavlink_router.sh
    ```
    Once installed you can either run mavlink-router manually each time or set it as a system daemon and start automatically (recommended)
    ```bash
    bash ~/mavlink-anywhere/configure_mavlink_router.sh
    ```
    As an MAVLink input stream, you should specify your mavlink source. On Raspberry Pi, if you using Serial hardware on GPIO its either `/dev/ttyAMA0` or `/dev/ttyS0`. you can double check with the command `ls /dev/tty*`.
    As output  you can enter as many endpoints as you need. eg. `127.0.0.1:14540 127.0.0.1:14550 127.0.0.1:14569`. You can add extra GCS endpoints here.
   
   - **Manual MAVLink Router Commands:**

  You can manually run `mavlink-router` commands as needed. For example, in SITL mode, depending on where SITL and PixEagle are running, you might use:

  ```bash
  mavlink-routerd -e 172.21.144.1:14540 -e 172.21.144.1:14550 -e 172.21.144.1:14569 -e 127.0.0.1:14569 0.0.0.0:14550
  ```

  Adjust the IP addresses and ports based on your network configuration.
  
3. **Install and Run MAVLink2REST:**

    ```bash
    bash ~/PixEagle/src/tools/mavlink2rest/run_mavlink2rest.sh
    ```

    This script will install and start `mavlink2rest` on port `14569` by default.

#### Ensuring MAVSDK Server Binary is Present

PixEagle requires the `mavsdk_server_bin` binary for full functionality. This binary is essential for MAVSDK integration with PX4.

1. **Check for `mavsdk_server_bin`:**

    The `mavsdk_server_bin` should be located in the project root directory (`~/PixEagle`). It should be compatible with your hardware architecture. 

2. **Download `mavsdk_server_bin`:**

    If `mavsdk_server_bin` is not present, you have two options:

    - **Manual Download:**

        Download the MAVSDK Server binary from the [MAVSDK Releases](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/releases/) page. After downloading, rename the binary to `mavsdk_server_bin` and place it in the project root directory (`~/PixEagle`).

    - **Automatic Download via Script:**

        When you run the PixEagle system using the `run_pixeagle.sh` script, if the `mavsdk_server_bin` is not found, the script will prompt you to automatically download and install it. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
    ```bash
    bash ~/PixEagle/src/tools/src/tools/download_mavsdk_server.sh
    ```


### Running PixEagle

You can run the entire PixEagle application suite with a single command:

```bash
bash run_pixeagle.sh
```

This script will:

- Automatically launch all necessary components (MAVLink2REST, Dashboard, Main Application, MAVSDK Server) in separate `tmux` windows or split panes.
- Check and free up default ports (`8088`, `5077`, `3001`) before starting.
- Ensure that the `mavsdk_server_bin` is present. If not, it will prompt you to automatically download it or guide you to download it manually.
- Provide a split-screen view for monitoring all processes simultaneously.

**Navigating Tmux:**

- **Switch between windows:** `Ctrl+B`, then number keys (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`).
- **Switch between panes:** `Ctrl+B`, then arrow keys (`‚Üê`, `‚Üí`, `‚Üë`, `‚Üì`).
- **Detach from session:** `Ctrl+B`, then `D`.
- **Reattach to session:** `tmux attach -t PixEagle`.
- **Close a pane/window:** Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.

**Customizing Execution:**

You can selectively run or skip components using flags:

- `-m` : Do **NOT** run MAVLink2REST.
- `-d` : Do **NOT** run Dashboard.
- `-p` : Do **NOT** run Main Python Application.
- `-k` : Do **NOT** run MAVSDK Server.



**Note:** instead of running `run_pixeagle.sh`, you can also run components separately using the provided scripts:

- **Run Dashboard Only:**

    ```bash
    bash ~/PixEagle/run_dashboard.sh
    ```

- **Run MAVLink2REST Only:**

    ```bash
    bash ~/PixEagle/src/tools/mavlink2rest/run_mavlink2rest.sh
    ```

### Accessing the Dashboard

Once the dashboard is running, access it in your browser at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

If accessing from another device, replace `127.0.0.1` with your machine's IP address. Ensure your firewall allows access to this port.

### GStreamer and CSI Camera Support

PixEagle supports GStreamer for video input and output, including CSI camera input. Configure your video source in `configs/config.yaml`.

**Note:** If you plan to use GStreamer or a CSI camera, ensure that OpenCV is built with GStreamer support. You need to build OpenCV from the source with the necessary configurations. A detailed guide is available [here](https://github.com/alireza787b/PixEagle/blob/main/opencv_with_gstreamer.md).

To verify your installation:

```bash
python src/test_Ver.py
```

### Key Bindings

While in the video window, you can use the following keys:

- `t`: Select target
- `c`: Cancel selection
- `y`: YOLO detection
- `f`: Start following (offboard mode)
- `d`: Try to re-detect target
- `q`: Quit

## Windows Setup

PixEagle is supported on Windows, but you may need to handle some steps manually as bash scripts may not work out of the box. In Windows, you should manually run:

- **Main Python Application:**

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

- **Dashboard:**

    Navigate to the dashboard directory, install dependencies, and start the dashboard:

    ```bash
    cd dashboard
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

- **MAVLink2REST and MAVLink Router:**

    You may need to run these on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or adapt the commands accordingly.

For detailed instructions on setting up PixEagle with X-Plane on Windows and SITL on WSL with PX4XPlane, refer to the [Follow Mode X-Plane Guide](https://github.com/alireza787b/PixEagle/blob/main/Follow_Mode_Xplane_Guide.md).
