# PixEagle Modernization Phase And Slice Map

Last updated: 2026-06-04

This file is the resume anchor after pauses, context compaction, or handoff. Use
it together with:

- `docs/reporting/agent-ops/codex-modernization/issue-register.md`
- `docs/architecture/pixeagle-modernization-blueprint.md`
- `docs/apis/api-modernization-blueprint.md`
- latest journal entry under `docs/reporting/agent-ops/codex-modernization/journal/`
- latest checkpoint under `docs/reporting/agent-ops/codex-modernization/checkpoints/`

## Global Goals

- Separate vision, tracking, following, telemetry, flight control, API,
  streaming, config, and UI concerns.
- Keep PX4 Offboard command publication independent of frame processing and UI
  state.
- Make `/api/v1` the typed, MCP-friendly public contract surface.
- Keep config, generated schema, docs, dashboard clients, tests, scripts, and
  runtime behavior aligned with one source of truth.
- Remove stale legacy aliases, duplicated docs, backup configs, placeholder
  tests, and misleading safety claims through tracked deprecation gates.
- Back every flight-control-adjacent claim with logs, exact commands, versions,
  configs, and evidence artifacts.

## Active Slice

Phase 3/4 boundary. Official Gazebo runtime proof (PXE-0040) is no longer
blocked by Docker permissions when commands are run through `sg docker`.
Runtime evidence is still incomplete because the official all-in-one
PX4/Gazebo container on this VPS/headless path exits with `Timed out waiting
for Gazebo world` before PixEagle visual evidence can be collected. Continue
local validation through reliable L2/L3 layers and proceed to PXE-0042 typed
SITL control actions and PX4 cadence evidence.

- PXE-0034: Concrete followers still mutate shared setpoint state instead of
  emitting an atomic command intent. Done in

- PXE-0014: MAVLink telemetry timeout/retry/staleness config and API freshness
  visibility implemented. Done in
  `checkpoints/2026-06-01-phase-2-mavlink-telemetry-freshness.md`; typed
  telemetry-health semantics remain PXE-0036.
- PXE-0035: OffboardCommander publish failures and dependency validation
  failures now cross typed thresholds, surface failed/degraded health, serialize
  stop/final publish behavior, and stop local following through tested
  fail-closed cleanup. Done in

- PXE-0019: deterministic synthetic video and gimbal replay fixtures now drive
  tracker outputs through public follower/control contracts, including stale
  visual and stale gimbal fail-closed paths. Done in
  `checkpoints/2026-06-01-phase-3-tracker-in-loop-validation.md`.
- PXE-0037: SITL scenario executor, owned fault injectors, PX4 artifact import
  and container auto-collection, manifest failure precedence, and structured
  MavlinkAnywhere route/profile validation are implemented. Done in
  `checkpoints/2026-06-03-phase-3-structured-mavlinkanywhere-validation.md`.
- PXE-0039: opt-in official PX4 SIH local/GitHub Actions profile implemented
  with dry-run default, probe-only mode, guarded PX4-only execution, artifact
  upload, Make targets, docs, and tests. Done in
  `checkpoints/2026-06-03-phase-3-px4-sih-ci-profile.md`.
- PXE-0040 prerequisite: generated H.264 RTP/UDP receiver proof implemented
  with a dry-run contract tool, guarded local `videotestsrc` sender evidence,
  async UDP/GStreamer `VideoHandler` path, fresh frame hashes, and post-stop
  stale/unusable frame statuses. Independent review blockers around reconnect
  lifecycle, stale acceptance strictness, caps ordering, weak docs, and
  portable artifacting were fixed. Done in
  `checkpoints/2026-06-03-phase-3-generated-rtp-udp-video-receiver-proof.md`.
- PXE-0040 profile contract: official PX4 Gazebo visual L4 plan, wrapper,
  opt-in workflow, Make targets, visual artifact import flags, and
  artifact-content validators are implemented. Review blockers around
  file-name-only evidence, weak scenario wording, and image/container digest
  policy were fixed. Done in
  `checkpoints/2026-06-04-phase-3-official-gazebo-visual-profile-contract.md`.
- PXE-0038 trace contract: normalized tracker/offboard JSONL helpers, guarded
  AppController runtime trace hook, strict Gazebo trace validators,
  deterministic AppController/follower/CommandIntent smoke, non-finite JSON
  rejection, and tracker docs are implemented. Done in
  `checkpoints/2026-06-04-phase-3-tracker-trace-artifacts.md`.

Objective:

- Keep the maintained official `px4io/px4-sitl-gazebo:<tag>` visual validation
  path operator-gated and record exact host/image evidence. On this VPS, the
  selected official image starts Gazebo but PX4 times out waiting for world
  readiness; full L4 acceptance needs a native GUI/better runner or a separately
  proven official-image startup workaround.
- Prove PixEagle ingests simulated Gazebo RTP/H.264 video through the same
  UDP/GStreamer receiver contract already proven with generated video.
- Package scenario-specific visual evidence with PixEagle video/tracker/follower
  traces, command traces, route/profile snapshots, config snapshots, PX4 logs,
  params, ULog/tlog where available, and exact image/tag/digest metadata.
- Keep claim boundaries strict: Gazebo visual SITL is simulation evidence only
  and cannot imply HIL, field, or real-aircraft success.

Acceptance:

- Generated RTP/UDP receiver proof remains green before any Gazebo camera
  evidence is accepted.
- Official Gazebo image can run headless on the selected validation host or the
  inability is recorded with exact command, tag, image, and missing capability.
- PixEagle ingests simulated video through the documented UDP/GStreamer path and
  produces tracker/follower/command artifacts without field claims.
- PX4 params, logs, ULog/tlog availability, route/profile evidence, config
  snapshots, and image metadata are captured or the run is incomplete.
- Normal PR CI remains free of external PX4/Gazebo runtime requirements until
  the profile has proven stable as an opt-in/nightly gate.

Current host boundary:

- Rechecked on 2026-06-04: Docker is installed (`29.1.3`). The current shell
  still lacks the `docker` group, but `sg docker -c 'docker ps ...'` works
  because `alireza` is now in `/etc/group`.
- `px4io/px4-sitl-gazebo:v1.17.0` is not a valid Docker Hub tag. The profile
  now uses `px4io/px4-sitl-gazebo:v1.17.0-alpha1-1551-g381149fb01` with repo
  digest `sha256:fe3608d282e214db19763d63e857b603781c6471fe0bc3276373927bb01f51db`.
- The official image starts Gazebo 8.11.0 and contains `gz_x500_mono_cam`,
  `gz_x500_gimbal`, and the `GstCameraSystem` UDP video plugin. The all-in-one
  PX4/Gazebo entrypoint still timed out waiting for `/world/default/scene/info`
  on this VPS/headless path, so no accepted L4 visual pass is claimed.

## Planned Slices

| Phase | Slice | Main Issues | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | Official Gazebo visual SITL runtime proof | PXE-0040 | Execute the hardened official Gazebo profile on native Ubuntu GUI/GPU, a stronger headless runner, or a separately proven official-image startup workaround; capture video/tracker/follower/PX4 evidence and keep the manifest incomplete unless artifact and content checks pass. |
| 3/4 | Lightweight synthetic visual plus SIH evidence | PXE-0038, PXE-0039, PXE-0042 | On this VPS, combine deterministic synthetic video/tracker traces with official PX4 SIH control-plane evidence and typed action contracts without claiming full Gazebo visual SITL. |
| 3 | X-Plane/Windows SITL disposition | PXE-0020 | Rewrite as maintained evidence workflow or move to historical docs. |
| 4 | SITL typed control actions and PX4 cadence evidence | PXE-0042 | Replace remaining legacy `/commands/*` SITL actions with typed `/api/v1` command/action resources and add parsed PX4 ULog/tlog or telemetry assertions for Offboard mode and setpoint cadence. |
| 4 | API/MCP modernization | PXE-0008, PXE-0022, PXE-0036 | Introduce typed `/api/v1`, structured errors, command/action resources, telemetry-health semantics, route migration tests, and companion sidecar standards. |
| 4 | Dashboard API/client normalization | PXE-0008, PXE-0021, PXE-0024 | Normalize clients, make stale/unusable tracker state operator-visible, and move from CRA to a supported frontend toolchain. |
| 5 | Gimbal provider expansion | PXE-0023 | Add MAVLink Gimbal v2 or vendor-specific providers when selected hardware/protocol evidence is available. |
| 5 | Runtime cleanup and docs parity | PXE-0041, remaining open/new issues | Remove redundant legacy code/docs/config after replacements are proven and publish a final no-legacy readiness report. |

## Pause Resume Checklist

1. Check `git status --short` and current branch.
2. Read this file, the issue register, latest journal entry, and latest
   checkpoint.
3. Refresh companion references before API/devops/docs slices:
   - `/home/alireza/mavlink-anywhere`
   - `/home/alireza/mavsdk_drone_show`
   - `/home/alireza/smart-wifi-manager`
4. Verify active slice and acceptance gates before editing.
5. Do not revert unrelated local changes.
6. At slice end, update journal, checkpoint, issue register, and offline copy in
   `/home/alireza` when the report matters for maintainer review.

## Review Gate

At the end of each slice, run focused tests first, then request independent
review against these roles:

- drone/PX4/MAVSDK safety and GNC
- computer vision, tracker/detector, and YOLO integration
- backend API, MCP, and typed contract design
- frontend operator UI/UX
- DevOps, scripts, Linux companion, and embedded operations
- product/field-operator readiness
- code hygiene and legacy-debt removal

Concerns from the review gate must be fixed or explicitly recorded as tracked
debt before moving to the next slice.
